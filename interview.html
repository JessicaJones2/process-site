				<h1>Interviews</h1>
				<p class="info">Interviews are something that we can all do to get more and maybe better information
					while learing something that you don't personaly know a lot about. Even though we maybe able to
					research and find some things we didn't know before, we will still be able to find more information more
					about the subject if we go right to the source of information..
				</p>

			<h1>Client interview</h1>
			<h4>I got to interview Dr. Ishaq, and below are the question numbered and his answers to them. He founded
				the International Child Art Foundation (ICAF) in 1997 in Washington, DC. to serve American children as
				their national arts organization and the world's children as their global arts organization. Over the
				past twenty-five years, nearly five million children worldwide have participated in the art programs he
				has developed, most notably the Arts Olympiad.</h4>
			<p>1) What is the job you do?
				<br>He is the chairman of ICAF and he runs the organization.<br>He runs the school art program all over
				the world and also runs the national art festival at the mall in Washinton D.C. every year. While
				doing all of that he also helps publish and design the school art magazine every four years.
			</p>
			<p>2) What would you say are some of your strengths and weaknesses?
				<br>One thing he said was that was part of both is that he has to have creativy for this job to help
				design and run everything but then also it is pretty hard for one main person to run most of everything
				on his own.<br>When he is looking to maybe hire someone he looks for them to be create and think outside
				the box for the company. To also get things done.
			</p>
			<p>3) What are some things that are most rewarding from this job?
				<br>Dr. Ishaq touched hard on what they do and how it impacts the children. He does what he does to be a
				good human being and to show that God wants human beings to create a better future for our upcoming
				children and family in the world.
			</p>
			<p>4) What kinds of promblems do you deal with?
				<br>The work load can be hard for him. He has longer days at work, not like a job where you go in at
				seven and go home at six. He is usually staying later and because he is higher up he also will take the
				work home with him. He said, "in a way the job will take over your life".
			</p>
			<p>5) What impact does this have on the world?
				<br>Kids making art is making more of a visual and art community. He talked about as we look around now
				we don't see very much of what kids do or create, only most of what adults do and what they make. He
				wants to really show the world what and how kids can create and how it can impact the world by making it
				more joyful.
			</p>
			<p>6) What impact does your job have on the people?
				<br>With the ICAF being a company for about 25 years there are many people that have been and still are
				being impaced. There are kids he remembers helping years ago and he might keep in touch with some or
				research them and find out later that they have grown up and are doing great things with thier life. So
				it is great seeing that their lives were impaced and are showing it in their story with what they are
				doing now in life years later.
			</p>
			<p>7) What are a couple skills to have for this job?
				<br>A couple things you need to have for this job are, good human relationships. Because you will be
				working with people and especially kdis it is really good to be able to communicate and have a strong
				desire to do that. Another thing that is good to have is inspiration. inspiration for the kids and
				inspiration for others to maybe just have a better outlook on life.

			<h1>User interview</h1>
			<h4>Below is an interview that was done with one of my peers. She is a communication major and is intersted
				in kids and being able to communicate. Because kids communicate through art I thought it would be a good
				insight into her thougts of how she might view the website.</h4>

			<p>1) Why may you have visited this site?
				<br>I propbably would visit this site because of the interest I have in the subject. When looking at
				what is already designed on the website I can see that the meaning is conveyed well. You are showcasing
				kids by having images of them but also by having images with kids creating art. The other message trying
				to be conveyed, art. Because of that I can tell you spend your time trying to figure out how to show the
				meaning behind the message you are recreating.
			</p>
			<p>2) What are a couple things that might be important to you on the site?
				<br>A couple things I would think are important for this website is showing more of a personal
				relationship with kids and somehow showing the art. Because of the image (like I said before) are there
				and they have kids creating art it does convey more of that personal message I would want to see.
			</p>
			<p>3) Is there something you wish was on the site and is not?
				<br>I think something that would be really cool to be on the website is maybe a place to sell the
				childrens art. I don't know for sure if people would buy them just because it is kids art but maybe that
				could be something as a test to see if it sold to the people first and then take it down if it doesn't
				work out as well. Even though that might now work I think it would be awesome to somehow send the art
				out to people, for a few reasons. So that they would feel more connected with the kids, in a way getting
				a part of the kids. I think if I got something related to a kid that way and the company was looking for
				funding that would be a good way to maybe get more funds.

				<h1>Insight comment about the interviews</h1>
				<p>An insight I had about these interviews is that when I take this information and look back at what
					they
					said i feel like I can be more personal because I interviewed Dr. Ishaq the founder of the company.
					He
					gave me insight to things I wouldnt think of if I just did a lot of research on him and the company
					because people dont post about everything he talked about. Nadia also gave me some insight into what
					may
					be some good ideas and if I were to create or have a company or job how I would think outside the
					box
					like that.
