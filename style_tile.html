				<h1>Style Tile</h1>
				<p class="info">This is where I have created my style tile showing more about my client and how I am
					designing the website.</p>
			</header>
			<p>The style tile here show cases colors from red to blue that go along with how my website will look. I
				choose these colors because I think they best fit the images I have chosen and also show casing more of
				a child like fun page. I have designed some buttons as my CTA to be a main focus of the main web page.
				Next are some adjectives that describe the feal and meaning to come across to the viewer. Next there are
				some images shown that I want to be present to show how the children would react to art supplies that
				would be bought with your donation. We can clearly see the joy on their faces when they get something
				they can have creative control over. The last two things are designs of how my main front webpage could
				look. I have two options to get feedback on, to see which ones commincate the best to what I am trying
				to convey.</p>

			<h1>CTA</h1>
			<h4>How I choose my CTA</h4>

			<p>This is my explantaion of why I choose to do my CTA and how i choose to do it. While deciding I thought
				about my primary users goal and what they would want to see on the website and what would keep them
				wanting to look around the website. Wheather that be with my words, colors, or design. How I communicate
				my over all idea and what I am thinking will be what in the end they think about. I need to do something
				so that when they leave the website they will stell remember it and want to come back to it later.</p>

				<h4>CTA Paragraph</h4>
			<p>
			My primary CTA for the website homepage is “donate”. I think from what I have researched about my client I
			have seen that donations would really help. With the overall company but also to help provide art supplies
			to kids and maybe travelling to places where the kids are located. I think if I have put a donation button
			on the main webpage along with images of the kids they might see how they would bless them when giving their
			money to the company and it might also help to entice them to give so they could see the happiness that art
			can bring kids. Putting the images of the children smiling from the art they can see that if they donate
			this is how the children will act. People like to see how their donations are making an impact on where
			there money is going and just knowing where their money is going will also make them feal more comfortable
			to give.
