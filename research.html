				<p>The Benefits of Art for Kids.
					<br>
					-	It encourages fine motor skills, neural development, and problem-solving abilities and that it can be used effectively to teach and understand other key subjects such as reading, writing, math, and science.
					<br>
					-	Therapists tell us that art is valuable because it allows children to process their world, to deal with sometimes scary emotions in a safe way, and because it gives them critical sensory input.<br>
					-	Artist tells us that art is important for its own sake as a source of beauty and expression as well as imply for the process of creating.<br>
					-	Kids tell us that art is fun, an activity they enjoy.
					<br>
					-	Parents tell us that rat is vital to their families because it keeps everyone engaged and happy and helps with the sometimes-difficult transitions of the day.
					</p>
					<p>
					Why Art?<br>
					-	Helping to develop mentally, socially, and emotionally.
					<br>
					-	Creating art may boost young children’s ability to analyze and problem-solve in many ways.
					<br>
					-	Their fine motor skills approve.
					<br>
					-	By counting pieces and colors they learn the basics of math<br>
					-	When children experiment with materials, they dabble in science.<br>
					-	When kids feel good while they are creating, art helps boost self-confidence.<br>
					</p>
					<p>
					How to talk to children about their art.
					<br>
					Question to ask are…
					-	“tell me about your picture” as a way to encourage conversation.<br>
					-	“what do you like about your work?”<br>
					-	“I see you used a lot of colors. Why did you use blue?” describe what you see.<br>
					-	“I noticed you made the lines go up and down.” Talk about their action.<br>
					-	“you made a lot of pictures today, which one do you want to hang up?” encourage and support.<br>
					-	“what part did you enjoy the most?” ask about the process.<br>
					<p>
					One of the growing problems is the high price of arts and crafts for children and prevalence of large number of substitutes for children, these challenges present difficulty to disperse art and crafts for the development and growth of kids.
					</p>
					<p>
					This survey considers the opinions of adults because these children aren’t often the ones buying their own craft supplies.<br>
					-	48% of all crafters believe kids crafts are getting more popular as a hobby.<br>
					-	74% bought kids crafts supplies in store<br>
					-	63% of participants are female and 37% are male.<br>
					-	Kids crafts are most strongly correlated with feelings of relaxation because they are happy and occupied.<br>
