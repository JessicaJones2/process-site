									<h1>My Primary Call To Action</h1>
									<p>Below is my CIT and how people should respond</p>
					</header>
					<p class="info">My primary CTA for the website homepage is “donate”. I think from what I have researched about my client I have seen that donations would really help. With the overall company but also to help provide art supplies to kids and maybe travelling to places where the kids are located. I think if I have put a donation button on the main webpage along with images of the kids they might see how they would bless them when giving their money to the company and it might also help to entice them to give so they could see the happiness that art can bring kids. Putting the images of the children smiling from the art they can see that if they donate this is how the children will act. People like to see how their donations are making an impact on where there money is going and just knowing where their money is going will also make them feal more comfortable to give.</p>
